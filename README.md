# Python_Project_Analysis
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer and transaction data to uncover meaningful patterns that can support business decision-making. 

The analysis aims to:

1)Understand customer purchasing behavior using historical transaction data

2)Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics

3)Identify high-value customers and revenue drivers.

4)Detect at-risk and low-engagement customers for retention strategies.

5)Provide clear visual insights that can be easily interpreted by business stakeholders.


Libraries Used:

Pandas – Data loading,cleaning

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib –static data visualizations

Seaborn – High-level statistical visualizations with enhanced aesthetics

Datetime – Date parsing and recency calculations for RFM analysis.


Visualizations Used:

1)Bar Charts –Customer count by segment
2)Revenue contribution by customer segment

3)Pie Charts –Percentage distribution of customers across RFM segments

4)Scatter Plots –Relationship between Frequency and Monetary value
Identification of high-value and high-frequency customers

4)Pareto Chart (80/20 Analysis) –Identifies top customers contributing to the majority of revenue

5)Distribution Plots –Transaction amount distribution to detect spending patterns and outliers.


Key Outcomes:

Successfully cleaned and merged customer master data with transaction records to create a reliable analytical dataset.
Identified distinct customer segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, At Risk, and Lost Customers using RFM scoring.
Discovered that a small percentage of customers contribute a large share of total revenue, validated through Pareto (80/20) analysis.
Highlighted high-frequency and high-spending customers, enabling targeted loyalty and upsell opportunities.
Detected low-recency and declining customers, providing insights for re-engagement and churn prevention strategies.
Generated business-friendly visualizations that clearly communicate customer distribution and revenue contribution by segment.
